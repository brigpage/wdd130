            <p>Hello My name is Brigham Page and this is my second go at a website after seemingly crashing and burning on the first one. I am new to this and we will see if this version goes a little better...It's been a couple weeks now and I can confirm that this is going better then it was before. I still have alot of things to learn but I think I am starting to get a little more hang of the overall process. 
                Just to clarify, my name is Brigham and I live in Washington. I currenlty work in law enforcement and love what I do. I am taking this class because computers skills are necessary in today's day and age and I am hoping to learn the skills now rather than trying to play "catch up" in the future after I have retired and possibly started looking for more employement opportunities. 
                I live in Washington with my beautiful wife, our newborn son, and my dog...who is more of a handful then my son, but that is not unexpected with a dog. 
            </p>
